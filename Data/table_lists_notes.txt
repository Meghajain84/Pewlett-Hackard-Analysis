1) find retirement eligible employees with their respective active departments and titles, find the count of employees that are retiring per department/ count of employees not retiring per department
2) find different titles that are available for a department and count of employees (retired-eligible ones / non-retired eligible ones as well) : they can take place?
3) people who are retiring what title they switched - so two columns - old role , new role

1) WHat title is retiring, - what different role/title they served - so it will help who can switch role? relation of roles - how an employee changed role
2) Employees with their latest role - they can mentor people according to role and duties that come along with them
3) count of retirees per latest title - so how many new people or existing needed? 
4) Employees who can mentor - age and their title (10 yrs left in the service)
